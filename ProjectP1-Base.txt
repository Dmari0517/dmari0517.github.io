Portal 2
Release Date: April 18, 2011
Rating: 10/10
Anyone who hasn't played a game of the Portal franchise just yet should make it 
their goal to try Portal 2 at the very least. The sequel to the original award-winning game 
brings the player back into GLaDOS's hands in a series of complex puzzles 
that require great environmental awareness to nail.

With the help of the portal gun, a player must traverse their environment 
by passing through time and space in the form of round portals. 
Meanwhile, they follow an engaging sci-fi story centered around a 
nefarious and hilarious AI that guides them.

It takes two 
Release Date: March 25th, 2021
Rating: 9/10
The game requires two players as you control a 
couple who have been transformed into dolls.
They have to remedy the situation with their 
platforming and problem-solving skills. Where this game 
excels is in its variety. The title includes all sorts of 
different puzzles, and each one fits the environment 
the protagonists are in at the time.

Keep talking and Nobody Explodes
Release Date: October 13, 2016 (PC), August 16, 2018 (Consoles)
Rating: 10/10
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a party game which 
forces players to work together in order to defuse a bomb. 
Essentially, one player is tasked with defusing a complex bomb, 
while the others have the guide on how to do it, but can't 
actually see the bomb. It's the perfect team puzzle game 
experience for an ice breaker, or just to 
build more synergy in a group and have fun.

Superliminal
Release Date: November 5th, 2020
Rating: 9/10 
Games that play tricks on your mind can be a headache 
to get through, but Superliminal is a whole lot of 
exciting, fun, and extremely weird. Your surroundings are 
definitely not what you think they are in this game where 
everything you see and hear should be questioned at all times.

The Talos Principle
Release Date: Decemeber 11th, 2014
Rating: 10/10
The Talos Principle introduces the player to an 
android character brought into a vibrant world of 
old ruins and technology, in which they must uncover 
the truth about themselves and humanity.

========================================

Action-Action-Adventure

This genre of games explore story telling naratives 
meant to provoke the players feelings good or bad. 
These types of games can also just be fun to play 
as if you get to play an interactive movie or book in real time. 
Action-Action-Adventure games are hit or miss for certain people
however I do think everyone should at try to find one to play 
because there most likely is a story for everyone. 

A Plague Tale: Innocence/Requiem
Release Date: May 14, 2019 (1st game), October 17, 2022 (2nd game)
Rating: 9/10(1st game), 9/10(2nd game)
While many games are set in unrealistic environments like outer space or 
alternate realities, some games take us to historical periods in the past.
A Plague Tale: Innocence takes place in the middle of the Hundred Years' 
War between England and France. By controlling 15-year-old Amicia de Rune, 
players must stealthfully avoid enemies as Amicia and her sickened brother 
Hugo try to escape French soldiers and infected rats of the black plague.

A Plague Tale: Innocence launched in 2019 on all major platforms and was 
met with an overwhelmingly positive reception, as well as winning 
Best Narrative at The Game Awards that year. A Plague Tale: Requiem 
launched in 2022 and continued the harrowing tale of the de Rune siblings 
and their hopes of surviving against the Order.

Ghost Of Tsushima
Release Date: July 17, 2020
Rating: 9/10 
Ghost of Tsushima was an incredible tale of sacrifice. 
Controlling Jin Sakai, Sucker Punch Productions forced you 
to truly think about whether or not the ends justified the 
means in trying to stave off the ensuing Mongol invasion. 
In battling the Mongols, Sakai is faced with decisions that 
will ultimately save his people, but damage his legacy 
and honor in the process.

Ghost of Tsushima has stunning set pieces that change 
throughout your playthrough. Many different sets of armor 
can be obtained that will alter Sakai’s appearance, as well 
as affect his attributes. Ghost of Tsushima received several 
accolades, including Game of the Year honors at the Tokyo Game Show.

Stray
Release Date: July 19, 2022
Rating: 8/10
If you've ever wondered how it feels to be a cat, 
then Stray is the perfect game for you. Taking place in 
an apocalyptic setting, you control a curious kitty that 
gets separated from its pack and is lost in the depths of the world.

The human race is seemingly extinct, as the main population 
in the ruins of Walled City 99 are robots called Companions. 
With the help of an A.I. named B-12, you must figure out how to 
open the enclosed city and return to the surface world.

Shadow Of The Colossus
Release Date: October 18, 2005
Rating: 9.5/10
Shadow of the Colossus follows a young man named 
Wander on a quest to bring a girl named Mono back to life. 
Wander must travel throughout the Forbidden Land to slay 
gigantic creatures to obtain the power to revive Mono.

Many look to Shadow of the Colossus as being a monumental 
game in terms of innovative gameplay, the setting as a whole, 
and the high emotions accompanied by the story. Since its 
original launch in 2005, Shadow of the Colossus was 
remastered on the PlayStation 3 in 2011 and then 
received the full remake treatment in 2018.

Horizon Zero Dawn
Release Date: February 28, 2017
Rating: 9/10
One of the biggest surprises of 2017 was Guerrilla Games’ 
Horizon Zero Dawn. The original story introduced an instant 
fan favorite in Aloy, a young hunter trying to survive in an 
apocalyptic world infested with robotic dinosaurs.
Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn received positive feedback for 
its beautiful open world and engrossing story. The success of 
Horizon Zero Dawn led to an expansion in the same launch year c
alled The Frozen Wilds, and a sequel, 
Horizon Forbidden West, which launched in early 2022.

Elden Ring
Release Date: February 25, 2022
Rating: 9/10
Elden Ring is the ultimate action adventure that 
puts you on an epic quest to become the new Elden Lord. 
You'll traverse the dangerous Lands Between, fighting 
against all manner of deadly creatures and deranged soldiers.

Unlike other FromSoftware games, Elden Ring is an 
open-world adventure and allows you to fight the demigods 
in any order you wish. Elden Rind has a robust customization 
system for character creation and gives you many different 
options to fight enemies. It has also won so many awards that it
is even being labeled as the best game of the decades winning about 
281 GOTY(Game of the Year) awards from media outlets and 43 from fan polls

========================================

Indie Games

Indie Games are games not made by big game companies and 
are contructed in small teams with love and passion. 
These games aren't for everyone but there definitely is an 
indie game for anyone. Some have beautiful storytelling, some 
great enviornments, some have mind boggling puzzles, and some are just 
tributes to classic videogames. 

Undertale
Release Date: September 15, 2015
Rating: 10/10
Undertale is an RPG title, modeled artistically on games 
like the Earthbound series, and decides to tell a unique story 
that satirizes the world of gaming, teaching you to play differently 
by popular throwing gaming tropes right out the window.

The game will teach you to befriend your enemies, to turn combat 
into comradery, and all the while; you’ll get to witness a killer 
soundtrack and some of the most innovative solutions that see this 
title compete with the best games of the era.

Celeste
Release Date: January 25, 2018
Rating: 10/10
This game has some of the tightest platforming mechanics, 
caters to speedrunners, offers a challenging experience, and has a fast, 
addictive gameplay loop—all the while keeping a minimalist, 
pixelated presentation that you can’t help but love.

Then just when you think this game is all about the gameplay, 
the game captivates you with its wonderful, touching story, 
which does a lot to raise awareness for depression and 
mental health, which is not something often seen within the medium of gaming.

The Stanley Parable
Release Date: October 17, 2013
Rating: 9/10
This title sees you play as office droid Stanley who wants 
to break free from the monotony of his simple, boring office job. 
However, how this decision pans out will depend on what decisions 
you make, your playstyle, how keen you are to explore, and your 
ability to think outside the box.

This game, much like Undertale, is a satirical game 
that pokes fun at the gaming industry at large and does so 
with aplomb. It’s not a ‘game’ per se. However, it’s an experience 
that will stay with you long after you step away from this one. 
So if you want to break free from the confines of traditional 
gaming tropes, this is the one for you.

Cuphead
Release Date: September 29, 2017
Rating: 10/10
Cuphead spent years in development, and you can see every 
second of that hard work on screen. Cuphead’s stunning 
animation perfectly captures the look and feel of 
classic 1930s cartoons and applies it to a retro-style, side-scrolling shooter. 
The bombastic boss fights are a visual feast you’ll never get 
tired of looking at again. That's great, as the challenging 
difficulty forces you to replay sections again and again.

Outer Wilds
Release Date: May 28, 2019
Rating: 10/10
‘Outer Wilds, simply put, is nothing short of being 
one of the finest games to have released in recent memory. 
Not only being a totally unique and challenging (whilst fair) 
combat-free game, but being bundled now with the DLC (Echoes of the Eye), 
which doubles the play time 
of the game, acting closer to a fully-realised and s
atisfying sequel than a simple expansion. This is a game 
full of heart and smarts, and whilst some people will definitely 
be put off by the huge amount of reading involved, this 
interstellar trip is well worth getting stuck into the in-flight material.’
Outer wilds is an achievement the likes of which cannot be understated, 
and it’s too soon to say for sure, but I personally hope that this 
game has as much of an impact on Indie games as many of the other games on this list do.

The game is set in 1960, and follows Jack who discovers the

an isolated utopia, the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which grants
