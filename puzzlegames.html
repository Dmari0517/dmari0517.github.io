	<img-wrap><img src="portal.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
	<br><p2>Release Date: April 18, 2011</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Anyone who hasn't played a game of the Portal franchise just yet should make it their goal to try Portal 2 at the very least. The sequel to the original award-winning game brings the player back into GLaDOS's hands in a series of complex puzzles that require great environmental awareness to nail.</p2></br>
	<p2>With the help of the portal gun, a player must traverse their environment by passing through time and space in the form of round portals. Meanwhile, they follow an engaging sci-fi story centered around a nefarious and hilarious AI that guides them.</p2></img-wrap>
	<h3>It takes two</h3>
	<img-wrap><img src="it2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
	<br><p2>Release Date: March 25th, 2021</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Rating: 9/10</p2></br>
	<br><p2>The game requires two players as you control a couple who have been transformed into dolls. They have to remedy the situation with their platforming and problem-solving skills. Where this game excels is in its variety. The title includes all sorts of different puzzles, and each one fits the environment the protagonists are in at the time.</p2></br>
	<h3>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</h3></img-wrap>
	<img-wrap><img src="kt.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
	<br><p2>Release Date: October 13, 2016 (PC), August 16, 2018 (Consoles)</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a party game which forces players to work together in order to defuse a bomb. Essentially, one player is tasked with defusing a complex bomb, while the others have the guide on how to do it, but can't actually see the bomb. It's the perfect team puzzle game experience for an ice breaker, or just to build more synergy in a group and have fun.</p2></img-wrap></br>
	<h3>Superliminal</h3>
	<img-wrap><img src="super.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
	<br><p2>Release Date: November 5th, 2020</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Rating: 9/10</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Games that play tricks on your mind can be a headache to get through, but Superliminal is a whole lot of exciting, fun, and extremely weird. Your surroundings are definitely not what you think they are in this game where everything you see and hear should be questioned at all times.</p2></img-wrap></br>
	<h3>The Talos Principle</h3>
	<img-wrap><img src="talos.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
	<br><p2>Release Date: December 11th, 2014</p2></br>
	<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
	<br><p2>The Talos Principle introduces the player to an android character brought into a vibrant world of old ruins and technology, in which they must uncover the truth about themselves and humanity.</p2></img-wrap></br>
