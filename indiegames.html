<h3>Indie Games</h3>
<img-wrap><img src="indie.png" alt="indie game" width="125" height="125">
<p2>Indie Games are games not made by big game companies and 
are contructed in small teams with love and passion. 
These games aren't for everyone but there definitely is an 
indie game for anyone. Some have beautiful storytelling, some 
great enviornments, some have mind boggling puzzles, and some are just 
tributes to classic videogames.</p2>

<h4>Undertale</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="ut.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: September 15, 2015</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>Undertale is an RPG title, modeled artistically on games 
like the Earthbound series, and decides to tell a unique story 
that satirizes the world of gaming, teaching you to play differently 
by popular throwing gaming tropes right out the window.</p2></br>

<p2>The game will teach you to befriend your enemies, to turn combat 
into comradery, and all the while; you’ll get to witness a killer 
soundtrack and some of the most innovative solutions that see this 
title compete with the best games of the era.</p2>

<h4>Celeste</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="ct.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: January 25, 2018</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>This game has some of the tightest platforming mechanics, 
caters to speedrunners, offers a challenging experience, and has a fast, 
addictive gameplay loop—all the while keeping a minimalist, 
pixelated presentation that you can’t help but love.</p2></br>

<p2>Then just when you think this game is all about the gameplay, 
the game captivates you with its wonderful, touching story, 
which does a lot to raise awareness for depression and 
mental health, which is not something often seen within the medium of gaming.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>The Stanley Parable</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="sp.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: October 17, 2013</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 9/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>This title sees you play as office droid Stanley who wants 
to break free from the monotony of his simple, boring office job. 
However, how this decision pans out will depend on what decisions 
you make, your playstyle, how keen you are to explore, and your 
ability to think outside the box.</p2></br>

<p2>This game, much like Undertale, is a satirical game 
that pokes fun at the gaming industry at large and does so 
with aplomb. It’s not a ‘game’ per se. However, it’s an experience 
that will stay with you long after you step away from this one. 
So if you want to break free from the confines of traditional 
gaming tropes, this is the one for you.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>Cuphead</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="ch.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: September 29, 2017</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>Cuphead spent years in development, and you can see every 
second of that hard work on screen. Cuphead’s stunning 
animation perfectly captures the look and feel of 
classic 1930s cartoons and applies it to a retro-style, side-scrolling shooter. 
The bombastic boss fights are a visual feast you’ll never get 
tired of looking at again. That's great, as the challenging 
difficulty forces you to replay sections again and again.</p2></img-wrap></br>

<h4>Outer Wilds</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="ow.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: May 28, 2019</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 10/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>‘Outer Wilds, simply put, is nothing short of being 
one of the finest games to have released in recent memory. 
Not only being a totally unique and challenging (whilst fair) 
combat-free game, but being bundled now with the DLC (Echoes of the Eye), 
which doubles the play time 
of the game, acting closer to a fully-realised and s
atisfying sequel than a simple expansion.</p2></br>
<p2>This is a game full of heart and smarts, and whilst some people will definitely 
be put off by the huge amount of reading involved, this 
interstellar trip is well worth getting stuck into the in-flight material.’
Outer wilds is an achievement the likes of which cannot be understated, 
and it’s too soon to say for sure, but I personally hope that this 
game has as much of an impact on Indie games as many of the other games on this list do.</p2></img-wrap>
