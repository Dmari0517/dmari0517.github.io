<h3>Action-Action-Adventure</h3><img src="adventure.png" alt="adv game" width="125" height="125">
</br><p2>This genre of games explore story telling naratives 
meant to provoke the players feelings good or bad. 
These types of games can also just be fun to play 
as if you get to play an interactive movie or book in real time.</p2></br>
<p2>Action-Action-Adventure games are hit or miss for certain people
however I do think everyone should at try to find one to play 
because there most likely is a story for everyone. </p2>

<h4>A Plague Tale: Innocence/Requiem</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="pt1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<img src="pt2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: May 14, 2019 (1st game), October 17, 2022 (2nd game)</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 9/10 (1st game), 9/10 (2nd game)</p2></br>
<br><p2>While many games are set in unrealistic environments like outer space or 
alternate realities, some games take us to historical periods in the past.
A Plague Tale: Innocence takes place in the middle of the Hundred Years' 
War between England and France. By controlling 15-year-old Amicia de Rune, 
players must stealthfully avoid enemies as Amicia and her sickened brother 
Hugo try to escape French soldiers and infected rats of the black plague.</p2></br>

<p2>A Plague Tale: Innocence launched in 2019 on all major platforms and was 
met with an overwhelmingly positive reception, as well as winning 
Best Narrative at The Game Awards that year. A Plague Tale: Requiem 
launched in 2022 and continued the harrowing tale of the de Rune siblings 
and their hopes of surviving against the Order.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>Ghost Of Tsushima</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="gt.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: July 17, 2020</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 9/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>Ghost of Tsushima was an incredible tale of sacrifice. 
Controlling Jin Sakai, Sucker Punch Productions forced you 
to truly think about whether or not the ends justified the 
means in trying to stave off the ensuing Mongol invasion. 
In battling the Mongols, Sakai is faced with decisions that 
will ultimately save his people, but damage his legacy 
and honor in the process.</p2></br>

<p2>Ghost of Tsushima has stunning set pieces that change 
throughout your playthrough. Many different sets of armor 
can be obtained that will alter Sakai’s appearance, as well 
as affect his attributes. Ghost of Tsushima received several 
accolades, including Game of the Year honors at the Tokyo Game Show.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>Stray</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="stray.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: July 19, 2022</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 8/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>If you've ever wondered how it feels to be a cat, 
then Stray is the perfect game for you. Taking place in 
an apocalyptic setting, you control a curious kitty that 
gets separated from its pack and is lost in the depths of the world.</p2></br>

<p2>The human race is seemingly extinct, as the main population 
in the ruins of Walled City 99 are robots called Companions. 
With the help of an A.I. named B-12, you must figure out how to 
open the enclosed city and return to the surface world.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>Shadow Of The Colossus</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="sc.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: October 18, 2005</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 9.5/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>Shadow of the Colossus follows a young man named 
Wander on a quest to bring a girl named Mono back to life. 
Wander must travel throughout the Forbidden Land to slay 
gigantic creatures to obtain the power to revive Mono.</p2></br>

<p2>Many look to Shadow of the Colossus as being a monumental 
game in terms of innovative gameplay, the setting as a whole, 
and the high emotions accompanied by the story. Since its 
original launch in 2005, Shadow of the Colossus was 
remastered on the PlayStation 3 in 2011 and then 
received the full remake treatment in 2018.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>Horizon Zero Dawn</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="hz.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: February 28, 2017</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 9/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>One of the biggest surprises of 2017 was Guerrilla Games’ 
Horizon Zero Dawn. The original story introduced an instant 
fan favorite in Aloy, a young hunter trying to survive in an 
apocalyptic world infested with robotic dinosaurs.</p2></br>

<p2>Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn received positive feedback for 
its beautiful open world and engrossing story. The success of 
Horizon Zero Dawn led to an expansion in the same launch year c
alled The Frozen Wilds, and a sequel, 
Horizon Forbidden West, which launched in early 2022.</p2></img-wrap>

<h4>Elden Ring</h4>
<img-wrap><img src="er.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150">
<br><p2>Release Date: Release Date: February 28, 2022</p2></br>
<br><p2>Rating: 9/10</p2></br>
<br><p2>Elden Ring is the ultimate action adventure that 
puts you on an epic quest to become the new Elden Lord. 
You'll traverse the dangerous Lands Between, fighting 
against all manner of deadly creatures and deranged soldiers.<p2></br>

<p2>Unlike other FromSoftware games, Elden Ring is an 
open-world adventure and allows you to fight the demigods 
in any order you wish. Elden Rind has a robust customization 
system for character creation and gives you many different 
options to fight enemies. It has also won so many awards that it
is even being labeled as the best game of the decades winning about
